        <p>I wanted to try an do this assignment with something smaller than a paragraph–just to see if I could do it. Like we discussed in class, I linked "answer this question" to the "Help" page. Also like we discussed in class, I broke up "pedagogies" to include more than one link (there is commentary about this hidden in the code...somewhere..mwahahaha). "Pedagog" is linked to the "Curator" page; it seemed like a natural connect to make since the curators are in a way pedagogs. The "-e" is linked to the "Praxis" collection, and the "Classroom" collection; both collections just felt right being linked in the <i>-ies</i> (because the -ies is what moves it from being a person–and classroom praxis).
