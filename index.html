        <p> I don’t believe there is only one way to <a href="https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/help"target="_blank">answer this question</a>, which is why I use “<a href="https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/curators/"target="_blank">pedagog</a>i<a href="https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/keyword/Praxis"target="blanbk">e</a><a href="https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/keyword/Classroom"target="_blank">s</a>” in the plural form.

        <!-- I originally had the -ies linked, but didn't want the link from "pedagog" and the other link from "ies" to blur together.

        Well, I thought I liked how I did it first (above) but then I decided to add another link here to make it a bit weird. HOPEFULLY the linke on the -e won't be undistiguishable from the others-->
